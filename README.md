A template repository for Neovim plugins.

## Status

This is work in progress, the plugin is working and is serving me for years, but it is not yet packaged as a configurable plugin, so while pro-users should be able to set it up for themselves by checking/modifying the keymaps in the code, it may be tricky for non-pro-users.
